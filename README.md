Technology Student Association software project for the visually impaired in the form of a Chrome extension.

Hudson just install git 🙏

To-Do:
 - Make actual icon and cover image
 - More vision disabiliy presets. Include fonts in some of the presets (like for dyslexic people)
 - Make the AI not stupid
 - Make the extension more visible in general. (Increased text size/spacing for those with poor vision)

!! TO MAKE CHANGES MAKE A BRANCH FIRST SO WE HAVE A BACKUP DON'T CHANGE THE WHOLE VERSION BY FEEDING IT TO THE GPT !!
