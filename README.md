Technology Student Association software project for the visually impaired in the form of a Chrome extension.

Hudson just install git 🙏

To-Do:
 - Make actual icon and cover image.
 - Save settings so that they still apply when you reload/change website to website
 - Make it possible to select presets for multiple vision problems. (if someone was dyslexic and colorblind they would need both presets)
 - Make the AI not stupid, so it can help users.
 - High contrast makes it impossible to read some websites like wikipedia, might want to fix
 - Make the extension more visible in general. (Increased text size/spacing for those with poor vision)
 - Post to Chrome Web Store

!! TO MAKE CHANGES MAKE A BRANCH FIRST SO WE HAVE A BACKUP DON'T CHANGE THE WHOLE VERSION BY FEEDING IT TO THE GPT !!
