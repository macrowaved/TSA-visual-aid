TSA project for the visually impaired.

Hudson just install git 🙏

To-Do:
 - Make actual icon and cover image
 - More vision disabiliy presets. Include fonts in some of the presets (like for dyslexic people)
 - Make the AI not stupid
 - UI makeover (fix spacing, make it less ugly)

!! IF YOU MAKE A CHANGE MAKE A BRANCH FIRST SO WE HAVE A BACKUP DON'T CHANGE THE WHOLE VERSION BY FEEDING IT TO THE GPT !!
